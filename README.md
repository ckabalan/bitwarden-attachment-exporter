# Bitwarden Export with Attachments

The instructions below produce a GPG-encrypted `export.tar.gz.gpg` with the following structure:

## Instructions

### 1. Create Basic Export

First log in into the bitwarden CLI client:
```bash
bw login
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
```

After logging in create your export with the following command:

```bash
bw sync
bw export --output ./export/bitwarden.json --format json
```

### 2. Download your Attachments

Choose from one of the following export structures. If you don't have the `jq` tool, download it [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

How does this work? The `bw list items` command outputs a JSON object with all of your credential data. Unlike the `export` command, the `list items` command outputs attachment information. This object is piped to the `jq` command which loops over the items, ignores the items without attachments, and then for each attachment forms a `bw get attachment [...]` command to download the attachment to the right local filename. The list of commands (from the output of `jq`) then passed to `bash` which runs them in sequence, performing the actual download.

This method is preferable to a hard-to-audit python script which understandably makes people uneasy when processing their most sensitive credentials. The command below may not be the easiest to understand but it should be obvious there is no nefarious actions be taken on your data.

#### Preferred: Item ID > Attachment Filename

Most people should use this format.

Format: `./export/attachments/item_id/attachment_filename`

Example: `./export/attachments/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde/Backup Codes.txt`

```bash
bash <(bw list items | jq -r '.[] | select(.attachments != null) | . as $parent | .attachments[] | "bw get attachment \(.id) --itemid \($parent.id) --output \"./export/attachments/\($parent.id)/\(.fileName)\""')
```

#### Alternative: Item ID > Attachment ID

Only use this format if your attachment filenames may be incompatible with your target filesystem (such as invalid characters or extreme length). With this method your export will NOT contain the original filename of the attachment.

Format: `./export/attachments/item_id-attachment_id`

Example: `./export/attachments/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde-01234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstu`

```bash
bash <(bw list items | jq -r '.[] | select(.attachments != null) | . as $parent | .attachments[] | "bw get attachment \(.id) --itemid \($parent.id) --output ./export/attachments/\($parent.id)-\(.id)"')
```

### 3. Create an Archive

Combine the export and attachments into a single archive using the command below:

```bash
tar czvf export.tar.gz export
```

### 4. Encrypt It

Encrypt the archive with a password using AES256. If you don't have the `gpg` tool, download it [here](https://gnupg.org/).

```bash
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 export.tar.gz
```

This file can now be stored knowing the contents are securely encrypted using industry standard encryption techniques. Don't forget your passphase and don't forget to clean up the unencrypted export and attachments!

### 5. How to Decrypt and Extract

Decrypt the archive:

```bash
gpg --output export.tar.gz --decrypt export.tar.gz.gpg
```

Extract the archive:

```bash
tar zxvf export.tar.gz
```

### 6. Optional - Script the Process

The above commands can be combined into a script that exports, downloads attachments, archives, encrypts, and cleans up all in one process.

See [bw-export.sh](./bw-export.sh) for a ready to use example.
